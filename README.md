# face-mask-detection
This is a notebook for face-mask-detection using Keras

In this project, I will be applying deep learning techniques to conduct facemask detection using this [public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset) on Kaggle. In recent times the spread of COVID-19 has caused many companies to mandate that their customers wear masks to reduce the spread of the virus[2]. Keeping track of customers by having someone check every person who enters the organisation's building is tedious and requires extra workers.
